# Section 06: Generative AI Controller Configuration

**Estimated time: 30 minutes**

## Overview

In this section, we will configure OpenAI as an external LLM provider and enable three key capabilities:
- **Generic Prompt** - General purpose AI text generation
- **Summarization** - Content summarization capabilities  
- **Sentiment Analysis** - Emotional tone detection

For reference, see the [ServiceNow documentation on configuring Generative AI providers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/zurich-intelligent-experiences/page/administer/generative-ai-controller/task/configure-a-provider-for-a-generative-ai-capability.html).

## Prerequisites

Before starting this section, ensure you have:
- ServiceNow instance with GenAI Controller plugin activated
- OpenAI spoke plugin installed and up-to-date
- Administrative access to the instance
- API key from your LLM provider

> **⚠️ Security Note:** The API key provided in this lab is for training purposes only. In production, use your own secured API keys.
> For the lab you can use this: 

`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`

## Step 1: Access OneExtend Capability Configuration

The Generative AI Controller comes with four capabilities by default. If you have installed other Now Assist applications, you may see additional capabilities in the OneExtend Capability table.

In this lab, we will be enabling three capabilities:
- Sentiment Analysis
- Summarization  
- Generic Prompt

### Access the Configuration Table

1. In the **navigation filter**, search for the OneExtend Capability table by entering: 
   ```
   sys_one_extend_capability.list
   ```

![OneExtend Capability Table](screenshots/image1.png)

2. **Open the record** for the capability you want to configure, such as **Sentiment Analysis**.

## Step 2: Configure Sentiment Analysis Capability

3. Open the record for **Sentiment GPT4 (OpenAI Chat Completion)**

![Sentiment GPT4 Configuration](screenshots/SAnalysis.png)

> **Important:** Only one capability can have "Default" set to true at a time.

4. **Open the record** for detailed configuration

## Step 3: Configure Generic Prompt Capability

6. Repeat the same process for the **Generic Prompt** capability

**Navigate to Generic Prompt:**

Set the capability as **Default** and **Active** for Generic Prompt functionality.

## Step 4: Configure Summarization Capability

7. Configure the **Summarization** capability following the same pattern

**Summarization Setup:**

![Summarization Active](screenshots/image10.png)

> **Important:** Only one capability can have "Default" set to true at a time.

## Step 5: Configure OpenAI Connection and Credentials

Now we need to configure the connection to OpenAI using the provided API key.

### Access Connections and Credentials

7. Navigate to **Connections and Credentials** to configure the OpenAI API key

![Connections and Credentials](screenshots/image13.png)

### Search for OpenAI Configuration

8. **Search for OpenAI** - In the search field, type: `*openai`

![Search OpenAI](screenshots/image14.png)

### Configure API Connection

9. **Open the OpenAI record** from the search results

10. **Create a new connection & credentials** and paste the provided API key

![Create Connection](screenshots/image15.png)

![API Key Configuration](screenshots/image16.png)

> **🔑 API Key Management Best Practices:**
> - Store API keys securely in credential stores
> - Rotate keys regularly (quarterly recommended)
> - Monitor usage and costs through provider dashboards
> - Implement proper access controls and logging
> - Never commit API keys to version control

## Step 6: Configure Builder Integration

### Activate OneExtend Builder Config

11. Configure the **OneExtend Builder Config** for Virtual Agent Designer integration

Because we want to use Virtual Agent Designer, we need to activate the `sys_one_extend_builder_config` for OpenAI.

![Builder Config](screenshots/image17.png)

### Configure Virtual Agent Designer Integration

12. **Open the Virtual Agent Designer record**

![Virtual Agent Designer](screenshots/image18.png)

13. **Verify configuration settings:**
   - **Active:** True
   - **Default execution mode:** "Async"

> **Note:** Async execution mode is recommended for better performance and user experience.

### Verify Activated Capabilities

14. Confirm that all capabilities are properly activated and available

![Activated Capabilities](screenshots/image19.png)

### Add Missing Capabilities (If Needed)

15. If any capabilities are missing, click **New** and add the required capabilities:
    - Sentiment Analysis
    - Generic Prompt  
    - Summarization

**For each capability, set:**
- **Execution mode:** "Async"
- **Active:** True

### Test Basic Connectivity

Before proceeding to the next section, you can test the OpenAI connection:

1. Navigate to **System Definition > Script - Background**
2. Run a simple test script to verify connectivity (ask your lab instructor for the test script)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Capability Not Appearing as Default

**Symptoms:** Multiple capabilities marked as default
**Solution:** Ensure only one capability per type is marked as default

### Issue: API Connection Fails

**Symptoms:** Connection test fails or timeout errors
**Solution:** 
- Verify API key is correct and active
- Check network connectivity and firewall rules
- Validate API endpoint URLs

### Issue: Builder Integration Not Working

**Symptoms:** Capabilities don't appear in Virtual Agent Designer
**Solution:**
- Verify OneExtend Builder Config is active
- Check execution mode is set to "Async"
- Restart the application scope if needed

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **PII Handling:** Configure appropriate data masking for sensitive information
- **Audit Logging:** Enable comprehensive logging for compliance
- **Access Controls:** Implement role-based access to AI capabilities

### API Security
- **Key Rotation:** Implement regular API key rotation policies
- **Usage Monitoring:** Set up alerts for unusual API usage patterns
- **Rate Limiting:** Configure appropriate rate limits to prevent abuse

## Next Steps
